export const components = { img: ImageWithAltText };

While working on my dialogue editor for my platformer game recently, I thought, why not make these

<UENode title="boring ass nodes" />
look more interesting?

## Where I've started

Below is a screenshot of what essentially is a Before and After.  
![Pictured from bottom to top: a node that's a prototype implementation of the Dialogue Node made completely in Blueprint, and a node that's been reimplemented with C++, with custom styling that looks almost like how the Dialogue box would look like in-game.](/cdns/before-and-after.png)

I use the [Flow Graph](https://github.com/mothcocoon/flowgraph) plugin made by MothCocoon. It's a design-agnostic node editor, that can be used for practically anything.

I personally use it for Event scripting, but recently I've decided to create a Dialogue variant of it. I still don't have a working implementation of the Dialogue system in my game, but just having the editor made to work the way I wanted it to is already helping me visualize certain dialogue segments.

Another plugin I also use is [Editor Scripting Tools](https://github.com/HoussineMehnik/UE4-EditorScriptingToolsPlugin) by Elhoussine Mehnik. I use it mainly for the Detail Customization Utility it provides, that lets me customize the Details panel for any class, using Blueprints instead of C++. It also lets me put in UMG widgets directly in there!
