Since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with video games and I wanted to play them anywhere I went. I've had a Nintendo DS, but for most of my life I've been a PC gamer and I really wanted to play them without being tethered to my big case PC.

In a way, the Steam Deck is my childhood dream come true.

I've been excitedly following news about it ever since it was first announced in July 2021. I watched all the videos IGN put out and I got captivated by it. A portable PC in an almost Switch-like form factor for just 2499z≈Ç (256GB version, $529 USD)? Compared to other handhelds, that was a steal. Needless to say, I got my reservation in pretty quickly.

Fast forward to March 2022 and a few variations of that one Asuka meme later, I got an email from Valve, saying my reservation is ready.

I did not think twice about it. It came in the mail about a week later.
